  <h1>Transcriptional Networks<h1>
  <p> 
    We have all come to know about central dogma more than often. It states that DNA is converted into RNA through transcription process and then the RNA is converted to protein through translation in the Ribosomal machinery with the exemption of reverse transcriptions (RNA is converted back to DNA). Here we will see the transcription of not a single gene but rather as a network comprising of several genes regulating each other. Transcriptional networks, a cornerstone of systems biology, offer a powerful lens to understand the logic behind this dynamic process in a sense that regulation takes place in several ways. These networks depict genes as nodes and their regulatory interactions as edges or arrows, revealing a web of interactions that govern cellular behavior. Embedded within this web lie network loops – fascinating structures that play a crucial role in shaping gene expression patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>Deconstructing the Network: Nodes and Edges</h2>
  <p>
    The nodes in a transcriptional network represent genes, the fundamental units of heredity. Each gene encodes a specific protein, and the network depicts how these genes influence each other's expression. The edges, often represented by arrows, depict the regulatory interactions between genes. These interactions can be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Positive regulation (activation):</b> Where one gene ("activator") promotes the transcription of another gene.
    <li><b>Negative regulation (repression):</b> Where one gene ("repressor") hinders the transcription of another gene.
  </ul>
